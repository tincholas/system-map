A strong theme is a seductive tool for a designer. It acts as an anchor, instantly generating a feature list that feels intuitive. If you are building a farming game, the theme practically screams for soil pH management, weather cycles, and crop rotation. It is easy to fill a design document with ideas that fit the world perfectly, creating a simulation that makes total logical sense "on paper."

However, fidelity to a theme is often the enemy of fun. I have fallen into the trap of implementing mechanics simply because "that is how it works in real life" or "that is what a pirate would actually have to do," only to find that reality is often tedious. When a mechanic is technically accurate but mechanically dull, the game suffers. A mechanic that perfectly simulates the waiting time of drying paint might fit a "Home Renovation" theme, but it rarely makes for compelling gameplay.

Ultimately, the system must reign supreme. It is always preferable to implement a mechanic that provides satisfying feedback and interesting tension, even if it requires a leap of logic to explain within the lore. Players will happily suspend their disbelief for a system that feels good to interact with; they will rarely forgive a boring system just because it is realistic. If you have to choose between a fun abstraction and a boring simulation, choose the fun.
