Complex game systems are notoriously difficult to tame. An unbalanced game feels broken, but staring at a blank database trying to intuit the perfect mana cost for a spell is a recipe for analysis paralysis. While playtesting is the ultimate arbiter of truth, you need a starting point. My approach is to retreat to the safety of spreadsheets and establish a "Standard Currency." This doesn't need to be actual in-game gold; it can be abstract, like "Turns required to acquire" or "Damage per Action." By converting every card, unit, or resource into this single standardized value, you can mathematically compare a movement speed buff against a fireball and establish a baseline of fairness.

However, don't let the math freeze you. An unbalanced but playable prototype is infinitely better than a blank spreadsheet waiting for "perfect" numbers. Pick a value, plug it in, and see if it breaks. You can always adjust the variables later, but you cannot test a system that doesn't exist. There are advanced tricks for decision modeling and probability that can refine this later, but the priority is simply getting the machine running.

There is, however, a danger in being too good at the math. I once spent weeks balancing a complex economy, ensuring every strategy had the exact same expected value and win probability. The result was a technically perfect game where every card felt exactly the same—and it was incredibly boring. True fun often lives in the outliers. Once your system is mathematically sound, you must intentionally throw curveballs. Create items that are slightly Overpowered (OP); introduce spikes in difficulty. Use the math to create the rules, then break them to create the excitement.
